= fourtyk

Take your long numbers and convert them to their shorter version.

== Install

  sudo gem install fourtyk
  
In your environment.rb file add

  config.gem 'fourtyk'
  
== Usage

You can convert any string or number into it's shortened version, just called shorten_number or shorten_money depending on what you want.

  40000.shorten_number # 40K
  40000.shorten_money # $40K
  "40000".shorten_money $ $40K
  1000.shorten_number # 1K
  1500.shorten_number # 1.5K
  
shorten_money just prepends a "$" sign to the shortened number. If you want to use a different currency just pass in the symbol for it to the shorten_money method

  "$3,500".shorten_money(:currency => "Â£")

== TODO

* Support precision options
* Improve upon number parsing

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
